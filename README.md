# chrome-extension-lead-tracker

The Leads Tracker is a Chrome extension developed to simplify the process of saving and managing web links.
The extension allows users to store URLs from the current tab or manually input text-based leads for easy access later. 
The data is persistently stored using the localStorage API, ensuring that saved leads remain available even after the browser is closed.
